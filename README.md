 # BIT Data Competition 2025 - Baseline Implementation
 
 **Repository for the MLSP Congress 2025 Classification Challenge**

 ## Overview
 This repository provides a PyTorch baseline implementation for participants of the MLSP 2025 "Body in Transit" (BIT) Data Competition. The code includes:
 - Data loading and preprocessing scripts
 - A simple model architecture template
 - Training (`train.py`) and inference (`test.py`) pipelines
 - Submission formatting utilities for the competition
 
 Participants can use this baseline to jumpstart their solutions for the **classification challenge** or the **"Beyond Classification" contribution track**.

 ## Getting Started
 
 ### Prerequisites
 - Python 3.8+
 - PyTorch 2.0+
 - Additional dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `tqdm`
 
 ### Installation
 1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https:github.com/[your-username]/bit-mlsp2025-baseline.git
    cd bit-mlsp2025-baseline
    ```
 2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 
 ### Run Baseline
 1. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
    ```
 2. Generate submissions:
    ```bash
    python test.py --data_path /path/to/test_data --model_checkpoint ./model.pth
    ```

 ## Dataset
 - **Original Labels**: Likert scale scores (1-7) as described in the [BIT Data Acquisition Paper](https:dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642651)
 - **Competition Labels**: Transformed to {-1, 0, +1} where:
   - **-1**: Perceived lighter than control
   - **0**: No perceived difference
   - **+1**: Perceived heavier than control
 
 The included `BITDataset` class handles this transformation automatically (see code comments for implementation details).

 ## Competition Tracks
 ### 1. Classification Challenge
 - Predict user perception relative to control conditions
 - Uses transformed ternary labels {-1, 0, +1}
 - Submissions evaluated on classification accuracy
 
 ### 2. Beyond Classification Contribution
 - Open-ended track for novel methodological contributions
 - May use raw Likert scores (1-7) or alternative approaches
 - Submissions evaluated on technical novelty and impact
 
 **Both tracks** accept paper submissions to MLSP 2025. Participants may use this repository as a starting point for either track.

 ## Submission
 1. Format predictions using `prepare_submission.py`
 2. Follow guidelines on the [competition website](https:bodyintransit.eu/bit-data-competition/)
 3. Submit both competition entry and paper draft by the deadline
